  "explanations": {
    "layer_height": "Layer height of 0.1mm provides a balance between quality and print speed. This is a finer layer height for higher quality.",
    "wall_line_count": "2 walls provides adequate structural integrity while optimizing material usage.",
    "infill_density": "20% infill with gyroid pattern balances strength and material usage.",
    "material_print_temperature": "Print temperature of 200\u00b0C is on the lower end of the recommended range for PLA. Lower temperatures improve detail but may reduce layer adhesion.",
    "print_speed": "Print speed of 40mm/s prioritizes quality.",
    "support_enable": "Supports are disabled as they are likely not needed for this model based on the print purpose.",
    "adhesion_type": "Skirt adhesion is recommended for better bed adhesion with minimal material usage.",
    "pressure_advance": "Pressure Advance value of 0.05 provides low to moderate compensation for pressure in the extruder, resulting in good pressure compensation for most PLA filaments. This helps reduce corner bulging and improves dimensional accuracy.",
    "input_shaper": "Input Shaper is configured with average resonance frequencies (X: 40.0Hz, Y: 40.0Hz) and uses mzv for X-axis and mzv for Y-axis. X-axis shaper (Modified Zero Vibration (good balance of smoothing and responsiveness)) and Y-axis shaper (Modified Zero Vibration (good balance of smoothing and responsiveness)) work together to reduce ringing artifacts in prints. This configuration allows for moderate print speeds and accelerations.",
    "max_accel": "Maximum acceleration of 4000 mm/s\u00b2 is moderate, which good balance of speed and quality for most printers. This works with Input Shaper to determine the maximum speed changes during printing."
